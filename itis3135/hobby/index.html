            <p>Driving is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy the independance I have every time I sit in the drivers seat.</p>
            <p>Weither its on a track or on the road, driving can be a relaxing and liberating expereince./p>

        <section id="When" >
            <h2>Best Times To Drive</h2>
            <p>Driving durring the day will offer the most visibility, driving at night is not recomended as the less ypu can see the higher your risk of crashing into somthing you wernt able to see.</p>
            <p>Driving in a storm should also be avoided as wet roads can make your car lose traction and lead to you gettign into an accident.</p>

        <section id="Where" >
            <h2>Best Driving Spots</h2>
            <p>The best place for you to drive is dependant on what you want to do. If you just want to go from A to B the best place to go would be the main roads, while it can be tempting to turn on the radio or put your own playlist of music on while driving, driving with the radio off can be theraputic or an oppritunity to collect your thoughts after a long day. If your just learning how to drive then you should probably do so in some neighborhood streets or an empty parking lot under the supervision of an experienced driver. </p>
            <p>If your looking to do somthing a bit more exciting, however, I have just the places for you. If your trying to learn how to drift (purposely oversteering so your car loses traction while maintaining control throughout the slide), I would suggest you go to an empty lot where you can LEGALLY drive and mark up the asphalt. Try asking the property owners of the lot or your local police officers if your allowed to practice, if they say yes then your good to go! I recommend that you try experimenting with slower speeds first until you get the hang of things. </p>

        <section id="How">
            <h2>How To Drive</h2>
            <p>Driving Itself is very easy and often necessary (In the US at least). The following instructions are for a automatic vehicle, if your looking to learn how to drive a manual you are on your own. </p>
            <p>First, you get in the drivers seat. Then you put on your seatbelt and ajust your mirrors and seat to your liking. Next you put the key into the ignition and turn it clockwise, keeping the key held all the way untill the car turns on (dont hold it after the car is already on as this will damage the vehicle). Lastly, disengage the parking brake and put the car into gear! Which gear you engage depends on where your parked, if you need to back up shift the selector to reverse (R) and if you need to go forward shift into drive (D).</p>

        <section id="Why">
            <h2>Why Drive?</h2>
            <p>Most people drive to get to work or school, a chore to get from place to place. </p>
            <p>What alot of people dont realize is driving can be as relaxing or as exciting as you want it to be, all you have to do is get out of your comfort zone and get onto the road.</p>
